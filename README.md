A car stats calculator for Drift Spirits

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to create a functional calculator where people can select which car they want to tune up and pick the various parts they need and so forth. Basically, it will function like the game does, but with the advantage of not needing to have all the items on their game profile to be able to do so. This is a video example of how the game functions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87zn3gbBhag

This is an old version of the Calculator: http://drspcalc.epizy.com

This new calculator strives to greatly improve the simplicity of the screens, a friendly user interface and much faster loading times.

## Current progress
The interface has been created and images have been placed. The current state of the project can be viewed here: http://drspcalctest.infinityfreeapp.com/

## Current problems
* No idea of how to implement the calculation and car statistics
* Current code might be too complicated and contain unnecessary elements
* This is my first time coding and I am honestly going in blind with this project
